**Author**: Nathan Hall
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 401 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Backpack and Library class library to add the functionality of creating books, storing and 
retrieving them from a library, and storing and retrieving them or any type specified from a Backpack.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Clone repo from Github. Open in MSVS. From here it's up to you, either run the tests to see that it works or create your own classes that utilize this resource.

## Example
<!-- Show them what looks like and how how to use the application.  -->
There is no good example for this. I would just have a look at the [tests](LibraryClasses.tests\Classes) to see usage.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
This was created using the language C# and .NET 5.0. 

## Change Log
